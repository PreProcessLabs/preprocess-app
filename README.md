# 🧐 PreProcess

🚧 Work in progress - this is beta software, use with care

A background screen recorder for easy history search.
If you choose to supply an OpenAI key, or a local language model like LLaMA, it can act as a knowledge base. Be aware that transcriptions will be sent to OpenAI when you chat if you provide an OpenAI API key.

## Uses

### 🧠 Train-of-thought recovery

Autosave isn’t always an option, in those cases you can easily recover your train of thought, a screenshot to use as a stencil, or extracted copy from memories recorded.

### 🌏 Search across applications

A lot of research involves collating information from multiple sources; internal tools like confluence, websites like wikipedia, pdf and doc files etc; When searching for something we don’t always remember the source (or it's at the tip of your tongue)

## Features

> - When no OpenAI key is supplied, and browser context awareness is disabled, PreProcess is completely private, data is stored on disk only, no outside connections are made
> - Pause/Restart recording easily
> - Set applications that are not to be recorded (while taking keystrokes)
> - Chat your data; ask questions about work you've done

## Development/Contributing

- Generally, try to follow the surrounding style, but it's fine if you don't, linters can fix that stuff
- Fork this repository, make any changes, and when you're happy, submit a PR
- I prefer to keep documentation in the code (that's the most likely place it won't go too stale IMO)
- If you have a feature suggestion, please submit it through the website and I'll triage it and add it to the planned features below (which is also a rough roadmap)
- mainline is latest - if you want a 'stable' (as stable as pre-release can be) branch use a tag

### Issues

- App sandbox is disabled to allow file tracking; [instead should request document permissions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70972475)
- Some results from searching fail to highlight the result snippet
- Keyboard navigation events: Return to open selected episode, escape to pop timeline view
- Apply object recognition per frame
- Test automation
- Unit tests for Memory
- Sync between PreProcesss
- Chat this episode
- Split episodes
- Incomplete features from the table below, or ports for Android or Linux

### Feature parity/Roadmap

In general, features further down the table are planned for future releases, in priority order. To bump a feature, put in a request through the website.
